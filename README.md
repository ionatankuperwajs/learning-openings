# learning-openings

**Implementation of the analyses described in Kuperwajs, van Opheusden, Russek, and Griffiths (2024).**

## Approach

This repository provides analysis code for studying learning in chess openings using Jupyter notebooks. The filtered data necessary to run the code is also provided. The raw data is available from the Lichess open database at https://database.lichess.org, while source code for preprocessing the raw data is available from Scoutfish at https://github.com/mcostalba/scoutfish.

## File description

- `preprocessing.ipynb`: generates the filtered data
- `learning.ipynb`: analysis for learning across multiple openings
- `Data`: filtered data split by opening in subfolders
